# Cuphead
Note: The entire project is contained in a single file, as it was developed in the first year before OOP was taught or allowed in the course.
Description: A recreation of the first levels of Cuphead, a run-and-gun action game known for its 1930s cartoon art style, challenging boss battles, and platforming-shooter mechanics. Developed from scratch in C++ with SFML, without using any game engine.
